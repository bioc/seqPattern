Updated to version 0.99.3 (24/03/2015)
23/03/2015    Added function plotMotifOccurrenceAverage() for plotting
              average profile of motif occurrence.
21/03/2015    Added function plotPatternOccurrenceAverage() for plotting
              average profiles of patterns occurrence.
18/03/2015    Fixed the problem of motif matching to Ns (which are assigned 
              weights 0) when PWM has very negative values.

Updated to version 0.99.2 (02/02/2015)
02/02/2015    Updated the man pages and the vignette.
01/02/2015    Adjusted the calculation of PWM score percentage for motif
              scanning functions to correctly calculate percentage of maximal 
              PWM score taking into account minimal PWM score as a baseline 
              (important when minimal score of the PWM is negative). The score 
              threshold specified as a percentage (e.g. default value of 80%) is
              now converted to PWM score threshold as follows:
                minScore(motifPWM) + percThreshold/100 * 
                (maxScore(motifPWM) - minScore(motifPWM))
Version 0.99.1 released in the development branch (07/01/2015)
